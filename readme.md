This application is built on the top of jquery and html framework and using html 5 localstorage to cache the data.

Launch the index.html with any browser like Chrome or firefox.

The assumptions of developer while built this application are as follows

1) There are few random numbers those have been sorted in ascending order.

2) The program will tell the asending order of the given default numbers and will show the changed position of every number in the new stack from the old stack.
3) The program give an open text box where user can only enter the numeric value and that value will be added to the last position of original stack but program will automatically sort and update this number to the sorted stack and position will be updated.
4) You can keep on added as many as numbers and updated stack will remain in the locastorage of HTML 5 if you close the application from the browser and open this application in the same browser again the new stack will be available e.g. whatever the users lastly added numbers will still remain in the program memory.
5) User can hit the clear button to initialize the program with the default stack.
